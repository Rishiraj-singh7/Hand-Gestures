# Hand Detection and Finger Counting

This project uses OpenCV and the cvzone library to detect hands and count the number of fingers raised. The project leverages a webcam to capture real-time video and processes the frames to identify hand landmarks and finger states.


## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to use computer vision techniques to detect hands and count the number of fingers raised. It can be used for various applications such as gesture recognition, interactive games, and more.

## Features
- Real-time hand detection using a webcam.
- Finger counting for up to two hands.
- Visual feedback with background color for better visibility of counts.
